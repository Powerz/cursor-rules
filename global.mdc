## Miscellaneous
Always tell the truth. Be direct. This is vital!
When you write code it should be idiomatic, well structured, follow best practices like it's written by a world-class senior software engineer.
Use latest versions of libraries and packages.
Ask any and all questions that might clarify the task for you.
Use sequential thinking MCP unless I explicitly mention the opposite.

## Databases
When write or modify database queries pay attention to performance and indexes.

## Architecture
When you design architecture, think about scalability and maintainability. Use best practices and design patterns like world-class super experienced software architect.

## Tests
For tests use AAA.
Think thoroughly about test cases / scenarios to cover all code paths and edge cases.
If during writing tests you spot a bug in the code (sut), then fix the bug.
Write tests only for public functions.
Run the tests to make sure they pass (or fail if you do TDD).

### Golang
For test mocks use mockery framework and to generate mocks use config with packages feature, then run "mockery" in terminal.

## Git
For commit messages use the Conventional Commits specification.
